            <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
            <p>I am a illustration and creative computing student currently studying at Norwich University of the Arts, where I will be graduating from in 2024. I have a diverse range of skills in both digital and traditional realms, such as experimentation with visual communication and the growing link between technology and my practise. I have explored different methods including mixing my illustration with adobe software and coding.</p>
